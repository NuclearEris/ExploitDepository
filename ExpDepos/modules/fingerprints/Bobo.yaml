description: 'Bobo is a light-weight framework for creating WSGI web applications.
  It''s goal is to be easy to use and remember. It addresses 2 problems: 1) mapping
  URLs to objects and 2) calling objects to generate HTTP responses. Bobo doesn''t
  have a templating language, a database integration layer, or a number of other features
  that are better provided by WSGI middle-ware or application-specific libraries.
  Bobo builds on other frameworks, most notably WSGI and WebOb.'
