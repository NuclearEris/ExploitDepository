description: Microsoft Personal Web Server (PWS) is a scaled-down web server software
  for Windows operating systems. It has fewer features than Microsoft's Internet Information
  Services (IIS) and its functions have been superseded by IIS and Visual Studio.
  Since Windows 2000 and FrontPage 2000, PWS was replaced by IIS as a standard Windows
  component. Personal Web Server was originally created by Vermeer Technologies, the
  same company which created Microsoft FrontPage, before they were acquired by Microsoft.
