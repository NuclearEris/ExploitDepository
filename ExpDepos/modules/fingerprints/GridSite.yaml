description: In its simplest application, GridSite uses X.509 certificates loaded
  into unmodified versions of web browsers like Internet Explorer, Netscape or Mozilla
  to authenticate users, and then grants read and write authorization on this basis.
  HTML and text files can be edited within a browser window, or pages and binary files
  can be uploaded from local disk. Certificate based authentification of users is
  now far more practical with the start of large scale issuing of X.509 certificates
  within Grid projects.
