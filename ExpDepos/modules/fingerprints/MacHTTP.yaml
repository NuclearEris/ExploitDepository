description: 'MacHTTP is a webserver designed to run on Mac OS versions 7.x through
  9.x. It was written by software developer Chuck Shotton and was originally shareware;
  it is now available in source code form from SourceForge.net under the Perl Artistic
  License. It is still used on some older Macintosh hardware. It was later commercialized
  as WebSTAR, sold originally by StarNine and later bought by Quarterdeck Software.
