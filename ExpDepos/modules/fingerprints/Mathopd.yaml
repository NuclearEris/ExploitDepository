description: Mathopd is a very small, yet very fast HTTP server for UN*X systems.
  It supports useful features of HTTP/1.1, such as persistent connections, partial
  responses and pipelining. It does not support things like content negotation. The
  latest version of the software (1.5) also supports CGI/1.1.
