description: The HTTP Server API enables applications to communicate over HTTP without
  using Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS). Applications can register to
  receive HTTP requests for particular URLs, receive HTTP requests, and send HTTP
  responses. The HTTP Server API includes SSL support so that applications can exchange
  data over secure HTTP connections without IIS. It is also designed to work with
  I/O completion ports.
