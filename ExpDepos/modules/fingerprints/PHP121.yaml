description: PHP121 is a web based instant messenger - written entirely in PHP. This
  means that it will work in any browser on any operating system including Windows
  and Linux, anywhere! If traditional messaging programs like MSN Messenger or Yahoo!
  Messenger are blocked at your school or workplace, PHP121 will still work.
