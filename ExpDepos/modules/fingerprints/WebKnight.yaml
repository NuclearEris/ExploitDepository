description: AQTRONIX WebKnight is an application firewall for IIS and other web servers
  and is released under the GNU General Public License. More particularly it is an
  ISAPI filter that secures your web server by blocking certain requests. If an alert
  is triggered WebKnight will take over and protect the web server. It does this by
  scanning all requests and processing them based on filter rules, set by the administrator.
