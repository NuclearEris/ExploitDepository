description: WebSVN offers a view onto your subversion repositories that's been designed
  to reflect the Subversion methodology. You can view the log of any file or directory
  and see a list of all the files changed, added or deleted in any given revision.
  You can also view compare two versions of a file so as to see exactly what was changed
  in a particular revision. Since it's written using PHP, WebSVN is very portable
  and easy to install.
