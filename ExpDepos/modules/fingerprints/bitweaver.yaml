description: Bitweaver is a free and open source web application framework and content
  management system. Its speed and power are ideal for large-scale community websites
  and corporate applications, but it is simple enough for non-technical small site
  users to set up and administrate. It comes fully featured on install but is modular
  and easy to extend.
