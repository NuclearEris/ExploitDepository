description: gSOAP Toolkit for SOAP Web Services and XML-Based Applications. The gSOAP
  toolkit is an open source C and C++ software development toolkit for SOAP/XML Web
  services and generic (non-SOAP) C/C++ XML data bindings. The toolkit analyzes WSDLs
  and XML schemas (separately or as a combined set) and maps the XML schema types
  and the SOAP messaging protocols to easy-to-use and efficient C and C++ code.
